Weâ€™re happy to be able to offer free childcare at the venue for children aged 3 and above for the first time this year.

Between 9am and 5pm, there will be a dedicated area with childcare professionals who will look after your children while you enjoy the unconference.

In order to use our childcare services, we ask that you register a separate, free ticket below and let us know everything that is important to keep your child happy during the conference. We will ask for your phone number and important information during the registration for child care. Please note that places are limited and available on a first-come-first-serve basis. The service is being provided by [Kidsevent](http://www.kidsevent.com/). Please check out their website for additional details (German only).

We look forward to welcoming you and your children to the conference!
