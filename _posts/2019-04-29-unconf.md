The ruby unconf 2019 in Hamburg uses an event format that allows contribution and participation of all attendees.

In order to center the event around the community and it's most important ingredients (you!), the unconf format has no predefined speakers or topics. Instead, everyone can propose a talk and the attendees decide what two days will look like.

## How does it work?
 * write down proposal on [proposal sheet](TODO: link) with talk title, your name and a very short abstract - you are a potential speaker now
 * potential speakers announces their proposal to all attendees during the opening
 * all attendees vote for their favorite proposals
 * schedule is set up by counting the votes and filling the slots in the agenda

Proposals are gathered before the opening, so make sure to fill out the proposal sheet during breakfast.
On the second day, the whole procedure starts from the beginning.

### Voting
// TODO: insert picture

After hearing all proposals during the opening of the unconf, you will vote for the talks that you want to hear. You vote using the stickers that you got with your ticket on the whiteboards close to the main hall where all talk proposals will be visible.

### Schedule
// TODO: insert picture

We will setup the schedule based on your votes. The top 6 voted talks will held in the main hall and the talks on place 7-12 will be held in the additional room. That way the talks that the most people voted for will not be held in parallel, but in sequence.

## Your unconf
If you want to propose a workshop, discussion, hacking session or anything else, feel free to grab a proposal sheet and write it down. We will try to make it happen by finding a room and all needed equipment for your needs. If you are unsure about an idea, please do not hesitate to ask us at the registration or write us an email to [info@rubyunconf.eu](mailto:info@rubyunconf.eu) upfront.

### Talk proposal feedback & Contriboot
If you are interested in giving a talk (no matter if it's your first or not) and want someone to talk about it for feedback, inspiration or help, let us know. We are very happy to help you or connect you with someone who has experience with giving talks. Please shoot us an email to [info@rubyunconf.eu](mailto:info@rubyunconf.eu), we are looking forward to talk you into becoming a speaker!

We are gathering contributions (talk proposals) and interests in our so called [contriboot](https://contriboot.rubyunconf.eu/contributions). By entering your talk proposal there, people can vote and inform themselves about possible talks during the unconf. **The votes in the contriboot do not counted during the event itself**

### Lightning talks
We have a spot for lightning talks on Sunday afternoon. We will gather lightning talks during both days. The first people that add their lightning talks to the list will get a slot of 5 minutes for their lightning talk.

Our unconf format is inspired by other barcamps, meetups and of course other unconfs. We could not make this happen without a lot of awesome people and we got our ideas mainly from these sources:
