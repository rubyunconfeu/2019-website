title:  "About sum.cumo"
---
We are a strongly growing, innovative digital company from Hamburg founded in 2010 and have since grown to about 140 employees with offices in Hamburg, Dusseldorf and Zurich.

We love to support the (tech-)community and the contact to and the network within it are very important success factors for us. Conferences, meetups and other events help us to build up a relevant long-lasting network.  
That is also why we are very happy to be one of this year’s Ruby Unconf gold sponsors.

The engine of our success are the people at sum.cumo – a bunch of very creative and passionate enthusiasts in the areas of digital consulting, ux, marketing and of course developer, who love trying out new things and are striving for approaches that successfully establish real, disruptive innovations.


Since 2010, we have grown rapidly. Very rapidly. That is why we are looking (amongst others) for developer (which make the majority of our employees) in our Hamburg and Dusseldorf offices to help us continuously create, develop and improve our cool applications.

So if you think, feel and work digitally, love to develop bleeding edge front- and backends and love to work in agile, interdisciplinary teams – you might be the right person for us.

We are looking for new colleagues who are looking for exciting and complex projects and do not want to write average code. We are very much looking forward meeting a lot of great people at Ruby Unconf on 25th and 26th May and to broaden our horizon.
