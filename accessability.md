If you’re not sure whether the concession rate should apply to you, please do get in touch.

Our goal is that the unconference and all other related events like the evening party on saturday are accessible to disabled people. However, we are aware that accessibility issues are diverse and we may not have everything covered off in our plans - please reach out, and we will do our very best to confirm we have those requirements under control. Send a mail to [tbd](mailto://tbd).

We will happily reserve you a ticket if it’s not immediately clear whether necessary assistance is provided or you have additional planning to do for your trip to Ruby Unconf.
