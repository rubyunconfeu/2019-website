## Diversity

Our scholarship program is meant to make Ruby Unconf a better unconference. We want to make this community-focused event accessible to the wide range of people who are learning, work with, or are Ruby enthusiasts. We welcome applicants from underrepresented groups in tech to apply. This includes, but is not limited to: women-identifying persons, people of color, LGBTQIA people, people with physical and mental disabilities and people facing economic and/or political hardships. Scholarship recipients will receive a Ruby Unconf Hamburg 2018 ticket.

Applications are now closed and we're looking forward to welcoming our scholarship recipients at Ruby Unconf 2018.

## Unconf you say?

What exactly is an Unconference? It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk. Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!

## Venue

We're hosted by the [Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Design, Media and Information](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english/about-us/faculties-departments/design-media-information.html).

</p>

### Getting there

The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station "Mundsburg", which is about a 7 Minute ride away from the central station ("Hauptbahnhof").

It's probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can't really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.

If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and then the U-Bahn to Mundsburg.

### Surroundings

The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake ("Aussenalster") which is probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny spring day.

Next to the train station "Mundsburg" is one of Hamburgs largest shopping malls which includes a cinema (if you don't like partying on saturday night, for example) - Be warned though, all movies there are probably shown in german.

## Hamburg

Getting to Hamburg is easy - the Wikivoyage travel guide sums up everything you need to know about getting to and getting around Hamburg, finding a place to stay or even moving here: [Wikivoyage - Hamburg](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hamburg)

If you are the first time in Hamburg we have some tipps for getting around here and what you should probably visit while being here. Having some days left before or after Ruby Unconf? [Hamburg is beautiful <3]({{site.baseurl}}{% link sightseeing.md %})
