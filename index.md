## Diversity

Our scholarship program is meant to make Ruby Unconf a better unconference. We want to make this community-focused event accessible to the wide range of people who are learning, work with, or are Ruby enthusiasts. We welcome applicants from underrepresented groups in tech to apply. This includes, but is not limited to: women-identifying persons, people of color, LGBTQIA people, people with physical and mental disabilities and people facing economic and/or political hardships. Scholarship recipients will receive a Ruby Unconf Hamburg 2019 ticket.

With the purchase of a diversity ticket you help us to make this happen.

The application form for diversity tickets will be available soon.

## Unconf you say?

What exactly is an Unconference? It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk. Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!

### Getting there

The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station "Mundsburg", which is about a 7 Minute ride away from the central station ("Hauptbahnhof").

It's probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can't really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.

If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and then the U-Bahn to Mundsburg.

### Surroundings

The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake ("Aussenalster") which is probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny spring day.

Next to the train station "Mundsburg" is one of Hamburgs largest shopping malls which includes a cinema (if you don't like partying on saturday night, for example) - Be warned though, all movies there are probably shown in german.
