## Sightseeing in Hamburg

First time visiting Hamburg? Having some days left before or after Ruby Unconf?

Hamburg has one of the busiest ports in Europe (third after Antwerp and Rotterdam). At the subway station Landungsbrücken, harbour tours are starting, where you will get information regarding the harbor while driving around with a small boat. Pro tip: There are also public transport ferries starting there which you can use with your HVV-Tageskarte. One of these ferries goes to "Övelgönne" where you can exit to take a nice stroll down the beach of the Elbe river, so called "Elbstrand".

On Sunday morning, starting at 5 am, there is the famous Hamburger Fischmarkt (Fishmarket) which is also a popular destination for people on their way back home after a night out partying, e.g. after visiting the bars and clubs of the famous Reeperbahn.

The Speicherstadt is the old warehouse district of Hamburg. Even today the old warehouses are still used for goods like cocoa, tea, coffee or carpets. But some of the buildings are hosting attractions for visitors, e.g. The Hamburg Dungeon and the famous [Miniatur Wunderland](http://www.miniatur-wunderland.com/), worlds largest model railway (If that sounds somewhat boring, don't let that impression fool you).

Planten un Bloomen in the center of Hamburg near the subway station Dammtor is a nice park for having a rest in the sun. In the park you can also find the palm house of the University of Hamburg. Entrance is free.

Within walking distance of the venue you'll also find the "Aussenalster", the large lake formed by the river Alster that flows into the Elbe a bit further down - If the weather is good, this is a very nice place for a walk and there are a couple of good ice cream parlors on the way.

From the top of St. Michael’s Church aka Michel you can see all parts of Hamburg. You'll have to pay about 5 EUR to get up to the tower and you have to take the stairs, but the view is awesome. An special recommendation is to visit the Sankt Petri Church opposite of the town hall. It is not so crowded and it is actually higher than the Michel.

Also, you don't have to take our word for it. Here are some recent articles from a couple of small publications:

## Public transportation

The public transportation in Hamburg is done by the [HVV](https://www.hvv.de/en/). The important thing to know is that you need to buy a ticket before you go on the platform and you don’t need to clock in the tickets, they are valid after you bought them. Don’t go beyond the golden lines on the ground without a ticket! For busses you can buy your ticket from the driver. For trains you there is a ticket vending machin on every station. You also can also use the [HVV app or their online shop](https://www.hvv.de/en/tickets/online-shop/single-day-weekly-tickets) to purchase tickets.

A 9-Uhr-Tageskarte - a ticket that is valid the whole day on weekends and in large parts of Hamburg - is the best option most of the time, even if you just take 2 rides. It costs around 6,40€. (It's a bit cheaper online or on the app)
