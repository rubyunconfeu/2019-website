    XING is the leading online business network in German-speaking countries. But XING is much more than just a brand – we’re also one of the largest and most active Ruby communities in Europe with over 400 software developers in Hamburg, Barcelona, Porto and Valencia.<br/>
    We come from more than 50 different countries and embrace New Work on an international level by allowing you to do what you really, really want to do in our small, self-organised teams. This gives you the freedom to think and shape your actions based on what’s best for our challenges and those of our members. While we pursue our company’s current 20% annual growth rate, we also pioneer New Work by creating true impact for our members who are faced with the onset of digitalisation, major demographic change, and entirely new values on the labour market. Our challenge unites all of our brands: XING, XING E-Recruiting, XING Events, XING Marketing solutions, kununu, kununu engage, Prescreen, HalloFreelancer, and InterNations.<br/>
    As you can see, we are no normal company and you can be part of it as we’re looking to hire more than 130 engineers in 2019. <a href="https://corporate.xing.com/en/career/" target="_blank">Join the challenge today</a>!
